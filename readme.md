# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## Week-08 Typography and CSS
### 1. Summary

Week seven and eight of MART-341 we learned about CSS and began to develop skills usging CSS in relation to typography, fonts and psuedo-classes.

This weeks assignment was to create a webpage about a fictional story or a news story, designing this webpage through the use of CSS elements.

### Process
Firstly I studied the notes given on the MART website.
Once I had read through both week 7 and week 8's data, I started to develop the news story I wanted to talk about.
I then went back through the notes to decide which key elements I wanted to display within my Webpage. examples being a hover-element, images, borders, unique fonts, psuedo-classes; first letter etc.
Once my plan was written up, I began my index.html first, later doing my .CSS file. I found doing it in this order the easiest for me, as I was able to get a basic structure and play around and alter how I wanted my webpage to b displayed in the end.

### Issues
This week I had alot of trouble again linking my images in such a way that they show in github. This is a process which I seem to get stuck with everyweek and although I manage to get it to link after time, for some reason I am really struggling with it initially. Perhaps there is something I seem to be doing wrong and this is why I am struggling with this issue.

### Future Work
I am definitely looking forward to working again with CSS, I really enjoyed this week and being able to see my webpage slowly become more and more personalized. I look forward to see what we will cover in next weeks class!
