      Sugarcane was one of the fastest growing agricultural crops between the 17th and 18th century. The industries massive growth began in the Spanish and British colonized islands of the Caribbean such as Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica. Due to the tropical weather and rich soils found in the Caribbean, the European colonizers, the British, French, Spanish and Portuguese found this to be the prime spot for sugar cane cultivation. Year-round warmth allowed for a longer growing season, no rest period for the crops and in turn rapidly growing economic value and opportunities. The massive success and demand for sugar, resulted with a want to produce more, further leading to the need for a larger labour force. As such the birth of the triangle slave trade was created.

  Sugar cane by definition is a type of grass, that can be grown rapidly and in large amounts. It is described as a tall, hard cane like grass, with a hard outer structure and a soft straw like inner structure. Sugar was the main product of the sugar cane plant, through the juicing and crystalizing of the inner stem of the cane. Sugar in the 17th and 18th century was widely popular around the world, commonly being used to produce Rum and Coffee

<center> Triangualar Trade </center>
</h2>
<p>
  In 1672 an association called the Royal Company of Africa was created. This company was developed to allow the transfer of African citizens from Africa to the British colonized islands within the Caribbean. Once there, the Africans were forced to work as slaves on the sugar cane plantations. These transfers of Africans were originally rationed out over time and limited to prisoners of war or criminals. The transfer limitations made it difficult for the British to meet the needs of the growing sugar cane plantations and therefore a new solution needed to be put into place. It was only in the year 1698 that the British parliament granted private companies also the right to transfer Africans across the Atlantic to the Caribbean. This later was known as the triangular trade. The triangular trade allowed the trade of African slaves for the exchange of other goods or commodities between the African continent, European continent and the Caribbean <a href="http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=12013003&page=2.">(Puerto Rico Encyclopaedia, 2012).</a>
  This trade has been noted down in history as one of the most inhumane historical events in human history, as millions of slaves were transported from Africa to the Caribbean from the 17th century to the late 18th. It was estimated that the British transported over 2,500,00 slaves and the French and Portuguese another 3 million (Puerto Rico Encyclopaedia, 2012). The conditions of the trans-Atlantic ships were known to be extremely poor. It was historically noted that the journey across the Atlantic was full of turmoil, disease and death. Only the toughest slaves could survive the entire trip, with an estimated mortality rate ranging between 8 to 18 percent per trip (Puerto Rico Encyclopaedia, 2012). The accounted deaths were believed to be from a combination of poor living conditions, lack of nutritional food, diseases and depression, all combined with the length of the journey. The most common diseases recorded as the result of most deaths during the Atlantic journey were measles, chicken pox and dysentery. Over the two centuries of the triangular trade it was estimated around 23 million African slaves died on the journey across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, A horrifying number that is still hard to comprehend today <a href="http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=12013003&page=2.">(Puerto Rico Encyclopaedia, 2012).</a>

  The introduction of the triangular trade had a major impact on the Caribbean that is present still today. The islands around the Caribbean have developed a culture that can be described as a melting pot of different cultures and religions around the world (Thanna’s place, 2013). Although the mass majority of slaves were brought across from Africa, it must be noted that after the abolishment of slavery, the indentured laborers were brought to continue the cultivation of sugarcane. These laborers arrived in 1845 and were a mixture of Chinese, Portuguese (coming from the island of Madeira) and Indian immigrants (Sugar Heritage Village, 2012).The wide range of mixed races helped create the Caribbean culture that is seen today (Thanna’s place, 2013). As well as developing a population increase seen within the Caribbean, as slaves and settlers moved in and out of the islands during the 17th and 18th and 19th century. After the end of the slave trade in 1838, industrialization began to take place throughout the Caribbean, and later Independence from the European Colonies began, all beginning with Haiti in the 19th century.

<center> Conclusion </center>

  <p>
In conclusion, the sugar cane industry similar to the description of the cane itself, was a hardcore, fast growing entity, that created centuries of turmoil, destruction and havoc throughout the European colonized islands of the Caribbean. However once cut, slowly started to fall apart as time passed on. It was a time of economic profit and human degradation. The triangular trade will always be noted in history as a time of power, control and hierarchy. The Caribbean, slaves and indentured laborers were dealt discrimination and hatred but rose with strength and unity; who made a choice bond together and recreate the unified culture seen throughout the Caribbean today. An example of this unity pack can been heard, pledged in the Trinbagonian national anthem, stating ‘this our native land…..here every creed and race may find an equal place”	Castange, 1962).
